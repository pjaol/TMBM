# Time Machine Backup Manager - Fixes Applied

This document summarizes the fixes applied to the Time Machine Backup Manager (TMBM) project to resolve build and compilation issues.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Syntax Errors in TMBMApp.swift**
   - Removed duplicate `@available` annotations
   - Fixed consecutive statements without semicolons
   - Removed duplicate menu bar extra code
   - Simplified the availability checks

2. **Project Structure Issues**
   - Created a proper directory structure with Sources and Resources folders
   - Moved Swift files to the Sources directory
   - Moved resources to the Resources directory

3. **Build Process Issues**
   - Updated the build script to compile files in the correct order
   - Fixed file paths to match the new project structure
   - Ensured proper dependencies between files

4. **App Entry Point Issues**
   - Removed the `@main` attribute from TMBMApp.swift
   - Created a proper main.swift file as the entry point
   - Set up an AppDelegate to handle application lifecycle

## Scripts Created

1. **build_tmbm_app.sh**
   - Compiles and runs the application from the command line
   - Ensures files are compiled in the correct order

2. **update_xcode_project.sh**
   - Updates the project structure to follow best practices
   - Creates a backup of existing files
   - Organizes files into Sources and Resources directories

3. **open_xcode_project.sh**
   - Opens the Xcode project file

## How to Use

1. To build and run the app from the command line:
   ```
   ./build_tmbm_app.sh
   ```

2. To update the project structure:
   ```
   ./update_xcode_project.sh
   ```

3. To open the project in Xcode:
   ```
   ./open_xcode_project.sh
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with TMBM Core Package**
   - Once the core package is stable, update the app to import and use it
   - Implement proper dependency management

2. **UI Refinement**
   - Complete the implementation of the placeholder views
   - Add real data binding to the Time Machine services

3. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for the app components
   - Ensure compatibility with different macOS versions
