## 1. Core Functional Requirements (Updated)

1. **View Current Backups**  
   - Provide a clear, chronological list of existing Time Machine backups.  
   - Show essential details for each backup (date/time created, size).  

2. **Storage Usage Overview**  
   - Display total and used storage capacity of the backup drive(s).  
   - Show space occupied by each backup (visual breakdown or bar chart).  
   - Alert users (via the menu bar/task bar icon) when storage usage approaches critical thresholds.  

3. **Backup Deletion / Cleanup**  
   - Allow manual deletion of specific old backups to free space.  
   - Confirm amount of space reclaimed upon deletion.  
   - Provide warnings about the impact of removing backups.  

4. **Backup Scheduling**  
   - Enable users to choose backup frequency (hourly, daily, weekly).  
   - Include an optional “Pause Backups” or “Snooze” function.  
   - Provide a clear indication of when the next backup is scheduled.  

5. **Sparsebundle Management (Advanced)**  
   - Detect and display the size/location of any sparsebundle file.  
   - Offer an advanced/optional view to tweak sparsebundle settings (e.g., resizing).  

6. **Backup Restoration Link**  
   - Provide a shortcut to the native macOS “Enter Time Machine” restore flow (or other relevant system restore mechanism).

## 2. **Menu Bar / Task Bar Integration**

1. **Persistent Status Indicator**  
   - Display a small icon in the menu bar (macOS) or system tray (Windows/Linux) showing Time Machine’s backup status (e.g., idle, in-progress, error, storage warning).  
   - Change the icon or add a badge (e.g., color change or exclamation mark) when immediate attention is needed.

2. **Quick Access Menu**  
   - Provide quick at-a-glance details (e.g., “Last backup: 2 hours ago,” “Disk usage: 70%”) when the user clicks on the icon.  
   - Include one-click actions such as “Pause Backup,” “Run Backup Now,” and “Open Backup Manager.”  

3. **Background Operation**  
   - The app continues to run at system startup (configurable via a “Launch at Login” toggle in the app’s preferences).  
   - Operate silently unless an alert (e.g., low space, backup error) is required.  

4. **Notifications**  
   - Trigger system notifications if backups are interrupted, if disk space is below a certain threshold, or if backups are paused for longer than a set duration.

## 3. User Experience & Interface Requirements (Updated)

1. **Simple Dashboard (Full GUI)**  
   - A dedicated window when the user wants a deeper view: backups list, scheduling settings, disk usage graph.  
   - “Free up Space” button leads to the Backup Deletion/Cleanup interface.

2. **Menu Bar Experience**  
   - Single-click or hover to see essential backup status and shortcuts in a small pop-up.  
   - Minimal yet informative design: next backup time, current disk usage, any urgent alerts.

3. **Accessible Language & Guidance**  
   - Hide advanced concepts behind an “Advanced” or “Expert Mode” toggle.  
   - Provide tooltips or short text prompts to explain each action.

4. **Platform Consistency**  
   - Follow platform’s menu bar/system tray guidelines (e.g., macOS’s small monochrome icons vs. Windows’s System Tray icons).  
   - For macOS, consider using Catalyst/SwiftUI or native frameworks for a fluid, integrated user experience.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements (Recap)

1. **Performance**  
   - Minimal CPU/RAM overhead when idle.  
   - Efficient scanning for backups.  

2. **Security & Permissions**  
   - Adhere to macOS sandboxing and permission requests.  
   - Request elevated privileges only for tasks like deleting backups.  

3. **Reliability**  
   - Handle network disconnections gracefully (e.g., if using a network drive).  
   - Log errors in a secure, user-accessible log file.

4. **Scalability & Extensibility**  
   - MVP design should allow future additions (e.g., multiple backups at once, advanced analytics).  

5. **User Support & Documentation**  
   - Provide brief, integrated help text for both the menu bar icon and the full GUI.  
   - Link to official documentation for advanced troubleshooting.

## 5. MVP Feature Prioritization (Updated)

### Must-Have
- **Menu Bar Icon / Task Bar Component** with quick status, critical alerts, and basic controls (e.g., pause/resume).  
- **Optional “Launch at Login”** to keep the tool active in the background.  
- **List and manage existing backups** (deletion, scheduling, disk usage).  
- **Clear disk usage visualization** and low-space alerts.  
- **Integration with Time Machine restore** (“Restore” link).

### Nice-to-Have
- **Advanced sparsebundle resizing** from the full GUI.  
- **Automated cleanup** (auto-delete oldest backups when near capacity).  
- **More sophisticated notifications** (e.g., specify backup errors vs. scheduling changes).  

### Future Enhancements
- **Cross-device backup management** (e.g., manage multiple Macs’ backups from one interface).  
- **Remote monitoring** (e.g., push notifications to an iPhone app).  
- **Detailed restore analytics** (showing size changes or large file backups over time).
