Below is a **sample Agile project plan** that breaks down the **requirements** (product + architecture) into manageable **user stories**—each sized at **1 story point**. These are grouped into **sprints** for iterative delivery. Each sprint is assumed to be **two weeks** long. You can adjust the duration or scope as needed based on your team's velocity and capacity.

# Project Plan Overview - Updated

**Goal**: Deliver an MVP GUI to manage Time Machine backups, including core functionality (listing backups, manual deletion, scheduling, disk usage monitoring) and a menu bar component that runs in the background.

- **Team**: 1–2 engineers, 1 QA, 1 UX designer (part-time), 1 project manager.
- **Methodology**: Scrum-like approach, with 2-week sprints.
- **Definition of "Done"**: Each story has clear acceptance criteria. Code is integrated, tested locally, and reviewed.

## Revised Timeline

Based on current progress, we estimate:

- **Sprint 4 Completion**: End of Week 8
- **Final Release**: Week 9

The project is making excellent progress, with most of the planned features already implemented. The focus now is on completing the testing, accessibility improvements, and release preparation tasks.

---

## Next Steps

1. Finish the accessibility audit
2. Complete the release packaging and notarization
3. Conduct final testing and QA

The project is in good shape, with the core functionality fully implemented, the project structure cleaned up, and source control properly configured. The app now builds as a proper macOS application bundle that can be launched independently from the terminal. The remaining work is focused on ensuring the app is stable, accessible, and ready for release.
