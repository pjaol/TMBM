Below is a **high-level software architecture** for a macOS application (and its accompanying background/daemon components) that manages Time Machine backups as described. This architecture considers Swift (and possibly SwiftUI), Apple’s system frameworks, and relevant system components (Launch Agents, menu bar items, etc.) for a cohesive, maintainable solution.

```

1. **macOS System / Time Machine**  
   - Utilizes **Time Machine**’s native APIs/commands (including `tmutil`) for backup and deletion tasks.  
   - The OS handles the underlying file system changes.  
   - Our application orchestrates tasks through well-defined wrappers.

2. **Core Logic & Service Layer**  
   - Encapsulates all business logic for listing, deleting, scheduling, and monitoring backups.  
   - Talks to Time Machine (via `tmutil` or any available private/public frameworks) and organizes the data for the UI.

3. **Data & Persistence Layer**  
   - Stores user preferences (e.g., scheduling, “pause backups” toggle) in `UserDefaults` or property lists.  
   - Optionally logs events/errors in a local file for troubleshooting.

4. **UI / Presentation Layer**  
   - Provides the primary interface (SwiftUI or AppKit-based) for users to manage backups.  
   - A separate **menu bar item** (NSStatusItem in AppKit or SwiftUI’s Status Bar icon approach) for quick status and control.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 TimeMachineService

- **Purpose**: Acts as the primary interface for any Time Machine–related actions.  
- **Functions**:
  1. **listBackups()**: Retrieves all existing backups (including their timestamps, sizes, etc.)  
     - Internally may call `tmutil listbackups` or parse file system structures on the backup volume.  
  2. **deleteBackup(backupIdentifier)**: Removes a specific backup via `tmutil delete` or by manually removing the folder and updating the snapshot (as described in the [Apple StackExchange link](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/39287/how-can-i-manually-delete-old-backups-to-free-space-for-time-machine/55646#55646)).  
  3. **getDiskUsageInfo()**: Reports total disk capacity vs. used for the backup volume.  
  4. **getSparsebundleInfo()**: (Optional / advanced) Inspects sparsebundle containers, including volume size or potential corruption issues.  
  5. **resizeSparsebundle(newSize)**: (Optional / advanced) Uses `hdiutil` to attempt resizing.  

- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Potentially uses a combination of **shell commands** (`tmutil`, `hdiutil`) and the file system for advanced/unsupported tasks.  
  - Wraps all calls in a dedicated Swift class, with synchronous or async/await methods.

### 2.2 BackupScanner

- **Purpose**: Periodically scans backups for changes (new, old, or partial backups) and updates the UI/state accordingly.  
- **Workflow**:
  1. Scheduled or triggered by user events (e.g., opening the app, user clicks “Rescan”).  
  2. Refreshes internal data structures about existing backups.  
  3. Triggers notifications if space is low, or if certain conditions (e.g., corrupted backup) are met.

### 2.3 SchedulingService

- **Purpose**: Manages user-defined backup schedules (hourly, daily, weekly) and any “pause” or “snooze” logic.  
- **Key Elements**:
  1. Uses **Launch Agent** or **Background Task Scheduling** (e.g., `launchctl` or modern equivalents) to initiate backups on a schedule.  
  2. Maintains state (UserDefaults or property list) for next scheduled backup time, frequency, etc.  
  3. Can pause/resume backups as requested.  
  4. Sends events (e.g., Notification Center) when backups start or finish.

### 2.4 StorageMonitor

- **Purpose**: Continuously checks disk usage thresholds and triggers warnings/alerts (e.g., 80% used) before Time Machine automatically starts purging.  
- **Key Elements**:
  - Periodically polls or leverages system events (where available) to detect significant storage changes.  
  - Integrates with the **Menu Bar / UI** to update icons or badges for warnings.

## 3. Data & Persistence Layer

1. **Preferences & Configuration**  
   - Uses `UserDefaults` for storing user choices like backup frequency, “Launch at Login,” or preference toggles.  
   - More complex or structured data (like backup lists, logs) might be stored in property lists or lightweight Core Data.

2. **Logging**  
   - For debugging and user support, maintain a **log file**:  
     - Records each backup event (time, success/fail).  
     - Logs user-driven actions (like manual deletions).  
     - Potentially integrated with the standard system logging (`os_log`).

3. **Security & Permissions**  
   - The app might require Full Disk Access or explicit user authorization to manage Time Machine backups.  
   - If restricted by Sandboxing, distribute either as a **notarized** app with the right entitlements or guide the user to provide these permissions in System Settings.

## 4. UI / Presentation Layer

### 4.1 Main GUI (SwiftUI or AppKit)

- **SwiftUI** recommended for modern macOS development and ease of building a flexible UI. However, **AppKit** is still viable for more detailed control or if you need certain legacy APIs.  
- **Architecture**:
  - **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** commonly used with SwiftUI.  
  - Each screen (e.g., “Backups List,” “Disk Usage,” “Advanced Options”) has a corresponding View and ViewModel.  
  - The ViewModel calls the **TimeMachineService** or **BackupScanner** for data.  
- **Features**:
  1. **Dashboard**: Overview of last/next backup, disk usage, recommended actions.  
  2. **Backups List**: Chronological table of backups with size, date/time, and quick delete.  
  3. **Scheduling Panel**: UI to set frequency, “Pause backups,” or advanced schedule rules.  
  4. **Advanced Panel** (Expert Mode): Sparsebundle management, resizing, deeper logs.  

### 4.2 Menu Bar / Status Item

- **Implementation**:
  - Uses **NSStatusBar** (for AppKit) or SwiftUI’s “menu bar extra” (macOS Ventura and later).  
- **Features**:
  1. **Status Indicator**: Icon color/state changes if backup is running or if there’s a disk space warning.  
  2. **Quick Menu**:  
     - Show last backup, next backup, disk usage percentage.  
     - Action items: “Pause/Resume Backups,” “Backup Now,” “Open Backup Manager.”  
  3. **Notifications**: Tied to `NotificationCenter`; e.g., a banner if backups are failing.

---

## 5. Supporting Services & System Integration

1. **Launch Agent**  
   - A `LaunchAgent` plist installed in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` for the user to automatically launch the app (or background service) at login, if enabled.  
   - This ensures the menu bar icon reappears each time and schedules remain active.

2. **System Notifications**  
   - If disk usage is beyond threshold or if Time Machine fails, the app can post notifications via `UNUserNotificationCenter`.  
   - For repeated alerts, an internal setting can limit how often or how many warnings the user receives.

3. **AppleScript / Command-Line Integration** (Optional)  
   - If advanced users want direct scriptability, you could expose some commands (list backups, delete backups) via AppleScript or a small CLI companion.

---

## 6. Security & Code Signing

- **App Sandbox & Entitlements**:  
  - Because we are manipulating Time Machine backups, we likely need special entitlements (e.g., Full Disk Access).  
  - The user may have to grant these in System Settings > Privacy & Security.  
- **Notarization**:  
  - Required for distribution outside the Mac App Store, ensuring the app passes Gatekeeper checks.  

---

## 7. Example Flow: Deleting Old Backups

1. **User** opens the app or uses the menu bar.  
2. **UI** calls `TimeMachineService.listBackups()` to show existing backups.  
3. **User** selects backups to remove.  
4. **UI** calls `TimeMachineService.deleteBackup(backupIdentifier)`. Under the hood:  
   1. `tmutil delete <path_to_backup>` or manual folder removal with system calls.  
   2. If successful, `TimeMachineService` logs the event.  
5. **UI** refreshes to show updated disk usage.  
6. **StorageMonitor** checks if usage is now below the warning threshold.  
7. **Menu Bar** icon reverts to normal state if warnings are cleared.

---

## 8. Development Considerations

1. **Concurrency Model**  
   - Swift Concurrency (async/await) or GCD is recommended for background tasks (listing backups, large file I/O) so the UI remains responsive.  
2. **Testing**  
   - Include unit tests for `TimeMachineService` logic (mock shell commands if needed).  
   - End-to-end integration tests for typical user flows (scan -> list -> delete -> verify space).  
3. **Edge Cases**  
   - Networked backups (sparsebundle over SMB or AFP).  
   - Corrupted backups leading to partial or invalid Time Machine data.  
   - Permission issues if user revokes Full Disk Access mid-app usage.

---

## 9. Future Enhancements

1. **Multiple Backup Destinations**  
   - Manage multiple backup drives or network volumes from one interface.  
2. **Analytics & Recommendations**  
   - Identify largest backup increments, show the user which files changed significantly.  
3. **Automatic Pruning**  
   - Let the user set custom rules (e.g., “Keep only daily backups older than 30 days”).  
4. **Remote Monitoring**  
   - Possibly integrate with iCloud or push notifications to an iOS app.
